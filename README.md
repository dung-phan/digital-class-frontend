## Features

As a teacher:

- You can sign up with your email and password
- After signing in, you can see a list of classes, identified with class number, start date and end date (ie: Class #1)
- You can create a new class
- You can add, edit and remove students in a class
- When clicking on a class, you can see a list of students and the progress of that class (based on their last performance)
- For each student, you can add evaluations to their performace of the tests, with RED equal to FAILED, YELLOW equal to PASSES, and GREEN equal to GOOD JOB.
- You can only fill in one evaluation per day.
- YOu can choose to ask students questions, based on an algorithm calculation (based on their latest performance): students with RED will have 50% of chances, while those with YELLOW and GREEN card will get 33% and 17% respectively.

## Create React App

This project was scaffolded using the create-react-app cli.
