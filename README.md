## Features

As a guess (without signup):

- You can sign up with your email and password
- You can see a list of classes, identified with class number, start date and end date (ie: Class 1)
- You can see a list of students in each class and the teachers' evaluations on their test results
- You can also see the progress of each class based on their last performance

As a teacher (account required)

- You can log in and log out with your account
- You can create a new class and delete a class
- You can add, edit and remove students in a class
- For each student, you can add evaluations to their performace of the tests, with RED equal to FAILED, YELLOW equal to PASSES, and GREEN equal to GOOD JOB.
- YOu can choose to ask students questions based only on their LATEST performance: students with RED will have 50% of chances, while those with YELLOW and GREEN card will get 33% and 17% respectively.
